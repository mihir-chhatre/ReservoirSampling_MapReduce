--A good cabbage should have a well-developed, firm head, with fresh, crisp leaves, free from worm-holes and decayed portions. To prepare for cooking, remove the outer leaves, divide into quarters, cut off the tough stalk, shake well to free from dirt, and if there are any signs of insects, lay in cold salted water for an hour or so to drive them out. Rinse away the salt water, and if to be boiled, drop into a small quantity of boiling water. Cover closely and boil vigorously until tender. If cooked slowly, it will be watery and stringy, while over-done cabbage is especially insipid and flavorless. If too much water has been used, remove the cover, that evaporation may go on more rapidly; if too little, replenish with boiling water. Cabbage should be cooked in a porcelain-lined or  granite-ware sauce pan  or a very clean iron kettle. Cabbage may also be steamed, but care must be taken to have the process as rapid as possible. Fresh young cabbage will cook in about one hour; old cabbage requires from two to three hours.

This is a granny's prescription, but I care not from what source I derive information, if it gives the satisfaction that this has done, upon experiment. This lady has raised a large family of her own children, and grand children in abundance. We have tried it with three of our children also, and prescribed it in many other cases with satisfaction, for over seven years. It is excellent also in common colds attended with much cough. This is from experience, too, whom I have found a very competent teacher.

Peel off the  rind  of several large  grape-fruit,  putting them into plenty of  salted cold water  as fast as they are peeled; when all are ready, put them into the  preserving-kettle,  cover them with  warm water,  and let them boil slowly; change the  water  every ten minutes, always replacing that poured away with more  warm water,  and boil the  grape-fruit  until they can easily be pierced with a broom-straw; then put them on a sieve to drain. In the  preserving-kettle,  put one and a half pounds of  loaf-sugar  and half a cupful of  cold water  for each pound of  fruit,  and boil and skim this sirup; while it is being boiled, cut into the stem-ends of the  grape-fruit  with a sharp small knife, and remove the stringy pith in the middle of the  fruit;  when the sirup has been skimmed clear, put the  grape-fruit  into it, and boil it until it is transparent. Put the  grape-fruit  into wide-mouthed jars, and continue to boil the sirup; when a little of the sirup cooled on a saucer  jellies  slightly, pour it over the  grape-fruit,  and let the  fruit  cool in the sirup. When both  fruit  and sirup are cold, lay a piece of paper wet in  brandy  in each jar, and seal them air-tight.

"Most individuals who avoid fat meat, also use little butter or oily gravies, though many compensate for this want-in part, at least, by a free use of those articles, and also milk, eggs, and various saccharine substances.

Bloomer vs. Todd was decided in August, 1888. When the statehood bill was rushed through the next winter the reason for the haste was plain. Women were to be excluded from voting for members of the constitutional convention, and suffrage was to be left out of the new state government. As four-fifths of the women were voting at the previous elections, no other method could have been successful in accomplishing this result.

RULES.  Gather together all materials and utensils that are needed. Grease the tins carefully, but not too much, and line with buttered paper. For cakes that are large and rich use  spring forms,  wich can be bought or made to order. Sift flour twice at least and measure after sifting. Measure or weigh the sugar, butter, milk and flour. Break the eggs, each separately, into a saucer or cup, always separating the yelks from the whites. Rub the butter to a cream with the sugar, which should be done with a wooden spoon, in a deep bowl, sifting the sugar into the butter is the easiest way. In winter set the bowl over hot water for a few minutes, as the butter will then cream more easily. Always add the yelks one at a time to creamed butter and sugar. Mix the baking powder in the last cup of sifted flour and add flour and milk alternately, until both are stirred thoroughly into the mixture. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, so stiff that you can turn the dish upside down without spilling the eggs. Always add beaten whites of eggs last to the dough and then set in the oven immediately.   Keep your box of baking powder covered so that the powder will not lose is strength. Use a common  kitchen cup  for measuring and always use the same size cup for measuring milk, sugar, butter and flour. Be sure that the oven is right before the cakes are set in, for you must never shake the stove or put in coal after your cake is in, and if possible have no water on the stove. Never look after your cake until it has been in the oven over ten minutes. All cake requires a moderate oven, for if put into a hot oven it will crust over before it is perfectly risen, and then as it rises the dough will force its way through the crust, making an ugly shaped loaf. When you think your cake is baked, open the oven door carefully so as not to jar the cake; take a straw from the broom and run it through the thickest part of the cake, and if the straw comes out perfectly clean and dry your cake is done, otherwise it is not done. When done take it out and set it where no draught of air will strike it, and in ten minutes turn it out on a flat plate or board. Don't put it in the cake-box until perfectly cold. If you wish to frost your cake do so while hot.

In the country, or where the luncheon is practically the children's dinner, the service should include soup or  bouillon  if possible; the latter is served in shallow bowl-shaped cups, the former in small  soup-plates.  A hot joint, with one  cold meat  if desired in addition,  potatoes  boiled or baked, and one or more hot vegetables, together with a simple dessert, gives a good luncheon variety. The covers are laid as for dinner, with napkin and  bread,  two knives and forks, a spoon, water-glass, and  salt;  if one  wine  is used, it may be claret or  sherry  at the family luncheon, or some malt beverage or  cider  may replace the  tea  or  coffee,  at the choice of the family. Among intimate friends an invitation to luncheon may be general, or it is quite proper for them to claim hospitality without it.

CUSTARDS, CREAMS AND ICES.  Remarks. The successfull preparation of these delicacies is a matter of considerable care and attention and the following condensed directions are necessary:  A custard-kettle is almost indispensible, but one may be improvised by setting a tin pail within a kettle or sauce-pan; it is made of blocked tin or tinned iron, one within the other, forming a water bath. Gelatine used for creams should be soaked for an hour or so in a little cold water or milk set in a warm place; a bowl set in the top of a tea kettle will be most convenient. Use it by pouring in the hot custard just after removing from the  fire. For creams or custards, eggs should be beaten in stone or earthenware to attain the creamy lightness desirable. For custards the usual rule is 4 eggs, a cup of sugar and a salt-spoon salt to a quart of milk. Bake in a baking-dish until firm in the center, taking care that the heat is moderate, or it will turn mostly to whey; it will thus be more delicate. For boiled custards, the yolks alone should be used, but for economy the whole egg; boil the milk in the custard-kettle, and when, by a light foam on top it shows to be about boiling, add the sugar; let it remain a few minutes, stirring until it thickens a little, but not long enough to curdle, then immediately set the inner kettle or pail, if not a custard-kettle, in cold water, or at once turn out into a cold dish; curdling will result from its standing in the kettle. Boiled custards require the closest attention until finished. A box-wood or heavily tinned iron spoon, with a long handle, should be used for custards or creams.  The moulds for charlotte russe, blanc mange, and all other creams should first be wet with  cold water before setting on the ice to harden. Gelatine is not neccessary for charlotte russe; the filling may be made stiff enough by using an egg whip, beater, or whip churn.

Apple  Puffs.   Pare the  fruit,  and either stew them in a stone jar on a hot hearth, or bake them. When cold, mix the  pulp  of the  apple  with  sugar  and  lemon-peel  shred fine, taking as little of the  apple -juice as you can. Bake them in thin  paste,  in a quick oven; a quarter of an hour will do them, if small.  Orange  or  quince-marmalade,  is a great improvement.

BROCCOLI	
(2533).  LOBSTER TAILS  IN THEIR SHELLS (Queues de Homards dans leurs Coquilles).  Detach the bodies, claws and tails from five small cooked  lobsters;  open the claw shells to remove the  meats.  Cut the five  lobster tails  lengthways, both  meat  and shell together; remove the  meats  from these ten halved shells, wipe the shells neatly, and fill the bottoms with a layer of preparation made with the  lobster  parings,  truffles  and  mushrooms,  mingled with a little chaudfroid  sauce  (No. 606), and finished with a dash of  cayenne pepper.  Season the tall  meats  and cut them up slanting without spoiling their shape, and dip them into half-set  jelly;  then replace each one in its half shell, the red side uppermost, and lay them aside in a cool place. This entr&#233;e is to be dressed on a dish foundation having in the center a pyramidical support, both of which are to be covered with  white paper,  then with a layer of thick chopped  jelly  pushed through a pocket; the halved tails are to be dressed with the points upward, five on each side; the claws are to stand upright on top of the support, and surrounded by  green parsley leaves.  The base of the halved tails is also to be surrounded by fresh  parsley,  and the bottom of the dish with pretty  jelly  cro&#251;tons ( No. 2442 ). As soon as the entr&#233;e is dressed place it in the ice-box until ready to serve, then send it to the table with a separate mayonnaise  sauce  (No. 606).

No part of our aliment is more important than our beverage. It is essential to moisten and convey our more solid food into the stomach, and from thence to the respective parts of the body. To allay thirst, to dilute the blood, that it may circulate through the minutest vessels, to dissolve and carry off by the watery secretions the superfluous salts we take in our food; to answer these purposes no liquid is so effectual as pure water, with the exception of some few cases. No other liquid circulates so well, or mixes so immediately with our fluids. All other liquors are impregnated with particles which act strongly upon the solids or fluids, or both; but water being simple, operates only by diluting, moistening, and cooling, which are the great uses of drink pointed out to us by nature. Hence it is evident that water is in general the best and most wholesome drink; but some constitutions require something to warm and stimulate the stomach, and then fermented liquors taken in moderation are proper; such as beer, ale, cider, wine, &#38;c. the choice and quantity of which depend on the age, constitution, and manner of living of the drinker; and to have them pure is above all things essential; as otherwise, instead of being of any benefit, they will be highly detrimental.

The color of the  jelly  may also be changed at every layer, by mixing in it more  burnt sugar,  some  carmine  or  cochineal,  some  green spinach,  a little in one layer and more in another. Any kind of ripe  fruit  can be used:  strawberries,   raspberries,  stoned  cherries,   grapes,   apples  cut in fancy shapes; also  peaches,   bananas,  etc.

--To a pint of  Indian meal,  add a handful of  wheat flour  and a little  salt;  beat three  eggs  very light and stir them, in turn with the meal, into a quart of  milk.  These cakes require no yeast, and should be baked as soon as mixed. They are baked on a griddle, and buttered before serving.	
germs are present in the juice of grapes; and under the influence of air, moisture, and warmth, they seize upon the sugar already present in the natural fruit juices, and any that may be added, and convert it into carbonic acid gas and alcohol. In the grains, a portion of the gluten ferments and changes the starch into sugar, and then the sugar into carbonic acid and alcohol. In converting the starch into sugar there is no change evident to the eye; but as soon as the sugar is decomposed into alcohol and carbonic acid gas, large bubbles of gas appear, which swell the whole mass.   Acetic fermentation  is caused by allowing alcoholic fermentation to go on beyond a certain limit, or in a temperature above 90&#176;. A familiar illustration of this is the change of wine or cider into vinegar.  Now, bread-dough contains gluten, sugar, and starch; and if the dough be kept warm for a certain time,  lactic fermentation  will be developed  spontaneously,  and the bread made from such dough will be sour and heavy. Alcoholic fermentation can also be  spontaneously  produced in dough, by making first a batter (as the semi-fluid state is more favorable to rapid chemical change), and subjecting it to a temperature of 110&#176; for five or six hours; then, adding more flour, allowing it to rise again, and then baking it. Bread made in this way is called  salt  or  milk-rising's bread.  But it does not keep well, and is not generally liked.  It is not always convenient to wait for dough to be raised in this manner, so we hasten the process by the addition of some active ferment. Leaven, or a piece of old dough, left to sour, and then mixed with the new dough was formerly used; this produced  lactic  as well as  alcoholic  fermentation, and though the bread was light and spongy in texture, it had an unpleasant sour taste. But since the chemistry of yeast fermentation has been understood,  yeast  has come to be considered the best ferment for producing alcoholic fermentation in bread rapidly, and with no objectionable result.

BROILED CHOPS   Proceed the same as for a  broiled steak.   The  loin  and rack chops will be treated in precisely the same manner. French chops are  loin  chops, trimmed. Save the trimmings for  stock.   An English or Southdown chop will be two inches thick and will require fifteen minutes. The ordinary American chops are not over half an inch thick and will require ten minutes. Serve with  tomato sauce  in the bottom of the dish, and plain creamed  potatoes , or plain with  peas  or  asparagus  tips.  In the ordinary gas range they will be broiled precisely the same as  steak.  With an  oil  stove they must be dry panned. Great care, however, must be taken, as  mutton  is much fatter than  beef  and is more liable to fry. Have the chops thin and cook them quickly; season and serve immediately.

"In the course of the interview Col.

His intention was, to present one of them to the President of the United States, another to the Vice-President, and a third to the Governor of the State of New York, and a fourth to some other distinguished citizen. His fellow-citizens of the County of Oswego had manifested a lively interest upon the subject; and it was no less in accordance with their feelings (and, indeed, with their particular desire) than with his own, that this distinguished citizen should be the gentleman whom he had now the honor to address, but whom he had not anticipated the pleasure of meeting in this city.

--In the fall, about the first of November, people in the country generally kill a good-sized pig, to last until "butchering time." To cure the  hams  of such, first, rub well, especially around the bone on fleshy side, with one-half of the  salt,   sugar,   cayenne,  and  saltpetre,  well pulverized (same proportions as for corned beef), adding a tea-spoonful  allspice  to each ham;put a layer of salt in bottom of  cask,  and pack in hams as closely as possible; let stand three or four days, then make a  brine  of the other half of salt, etc., and pour over  meat,  putting a good weight on top; when it has lain three or four weeks it is ready for use.	
Scald the churn, and cool with ice or spring water; pour in the thick cream. Chum rather fast, until the butter-flakes left by the dasher upon the top, show that the end to be gained is near-then more slowly. The motion should always be regular. In warm weather pour a little cold water into the churn, should the butter come slowly. Take it up with the perforated dasher, turning it dexterously just below the surface of the butter-milk, to catch every stray bit. Have ready some clean,	
Scald  milk,  add  sugar  and  salt,  when lukewarm, add  yeast cake,  let stand 5 minutes, then add 2 cups  flour,  beat well. Cover and let rise in a warm place, until light. Add the  eggs,  well beaten, then the  butter  and the rest of the ingredients with the remaining  flour,  and only enough more  flour  to knead. Knead until the dough blisters and is smooth and elastic.	
1 bunch  oyster -plant, or  salsify.   2  eggs -well beaten.  1/2 cup  milk.    Flour  for thin batter, and  lard  or dripping for frying.   Pepper  and  salt.   Wash, scrape and grate the  salsify,  and stir into the batter, beating  hard  at the last. It should be about as thick as fritter batter. Season, and drop, by the spoonful, into the hot  fat.  Try a little, at first, to see if batter and  fat  are right. As fast as they are fried, throw into a hot cullender, set over a bowl in the oven. Send to table dry and hot.

Milk should be regarded as a food rather than as a beverage. While it is a liquid outside the body, as soon as it enters the stomach it is made solid by the action of rennin, which causes it to become clotted. Milk is of most value in a mixed dietary, when taken between meals with a cracker or piece of bread, and it should be sipped rather than drunk. If taken quickly in large quantities, so dense a curd is formed in the stomach that it is with difficulty that the gastric juice acts upon it. As has been stated, each food calls forth a special kind of gastric juice, and in the case of milk it is in moderate supply and of moderate strength. Children absorb nintey-six per cent of the total solids of milk, while adults absorb eighty-nine per cent. With the aged, as digestion becomes impaired, milk should hold a prominent place in the daily dietary.

Another good example of the action of yeast is seen in the home manufacture of root beer and similar beverages. The extract purchased provides the agreeable herb flavor, but the directions for making require the addition of both yeast and sugar, and it is the action of the yeast on the sugar which gives the slightly exhilarating quality (from the small percentage of alcohol produced) and the effervescence (from the action of the carbon-dioxide).

LETTERS.--For letter-writing, always use good paper; it should be fine, smooth, white, and sufficiently thick not to let the writing show through on the other side. Very good letter-paper can seldom be purchased at less than twenty-five cents per quire. That which is lower in price is inferior in quality. If you cannot trust yourself to write straightly without some guide, have printed ruled lines to slip beneath the page; for a letter does not look well if written on paper that is already ruled with pale blue ink. If you write a small hand, your lines should be closer together than if your writing is large. It is well to have several sorts of ruled lines; they are to be bought at any stationer's for a few cents a page.

Calf's head  should be cleansed with very great care; particularly the lights. The head, the heart, and the lights should boil full two hours; the liver should be boiled only one hour. It is better to leave the wind-pipe on, for if it hangs out of the pot while the  head  is cooking, all the froth will escape through it. The brains, after being thoroughly washed, should be put in a little bag, with one  pounded cracker,  or as much  crumbled bread, --seasoned with sifted  sage,  and tied up and boiled one hour. After the brains are boiled, they should be well broken up with a knife, and peppered, salted, and buttered. They should be put upon the table in a bowl by themselves.  Boiling water,  thickened with  flour-and-water,  with  butter  melted in it is the proper sauce; some people love  vinegar  and  pepper  mixed with the  melted butter;  but all are not fond of it; and it is easy for each one to add it for themselves.

Three pounds of  sauerkraut  (or one can), six  sour apples,  one can  tomatoes,  two tablespoons of  salt,  one-half cup  sugar,  one tablespoon  pepper sauce,  one pint  water,  one large  onion,  four tablespoons  suet,  three tablespoons  flour  and a little  soup stock . Boil the  tomatoes  about ten minutes, then strain them into the  sauerkraut;  add the peeled and sliced  apples,  the  salt,   sugar,   pepper sauce  and  water,  and boil all together about one hour and a half. Brown the  flour  in the  suet,  then the finely chopped  onion,  and add the  sauerkraut  and  soup stock , heating them all thoroughly together.	
For  Pies,  roll the puff paste out a quarter of an inch thick, then roll up, and cut from the end of the roll. Turn each piece on the side, so that the folds show in rings, and pat out flat, then roll to fit the plate. Keep the paste in a circular form, and roll evenly in every direction. Make slightly larger than the plate, as the paste shrinks when taken from the board, and should be fulled in rather than stretched to the required size. After a little practice it is just as easy to judge of the amount of paste required for one crust, and roll it in this way to fit the plate, as to roll so large a quantity that the edges have to be trimmed off and mixed with the remainder of the paste. Roll some of the paste, and cut into strips three quarters of an inch wide; wet the under crust and place the rim on the edge. Use one rim for pies which are to be covered, and two, if you

French peas are also prepared in a number of special forms--the most important of which is  Petits Pois au Beurre,   "small, or new, peas in butter." Ordinary canned peas require seasoning before service, but in this style the seasoning is added before canning and they require nothing but heating. A well-trained palate is needed to distinguish them from the fresh vegetable.

Certainly the best way to prepare  pork  cutlets is to broil them; when fried they lose their finest qualities. From a small rack cut off six cutlets beat, pare, season and roll them in a little  oil,  then broil over a good fire for twelve to fourteen minutes, being careful to turn them; trim the handles with  paper  frills  (No. 10) , and dress on a very hot dish.

that which should in part have been done in the mouth; and this produces mischief in two ways;--first, by the over-tasking which I have alluded to--and secondly, by the want of action on the part of the teeth and salivary glands.LOAF BREAD.--In travelling among the Dutch population of this country, I have sometimes met with loaf bread made wholly of Indian meal. I do not think it so good as the cakes, yet I believe it deserves a better reputation than it would be likely to receive among us, who are of English origin.

By far the greater part of the eggs held over for future use are kept in condition in cold storage, but when this is impossible they may be preserved by immersion in a solution of water-glass ( Sodium  and  Potassium Silicate ). Experiments, both in a practical way and in laboratories, have demonstrated that a 10% solution of water-glass will preserve them so effectively that even at the end of three or four months they will appear fresh. In most packed eggs, the yolk soon settles to one side, and the egg is then inferior in quality, but in those preserved for three and a half months in water-glass, the yolk retained its normal position. One gallon of the solution is sufficient for fifty dozen eggs if they are properly packed.

Cut the curd, when fully formed, carefully with a knife; never break it with your hand; and be very particular when draining it from the whey, not to squeeze or handle the curd; if you make the  white whey  run from the curd, you lose much of the richness of the cheese.

is a problem many housekeepers never solve. Remember that grease is not gravy, neither is raw flour. Almost any kind of  meat-liquor or soup stock,  from which all fat has been removed, may be made into nice gravy, by simply adding a little  seasoning  and some thickening; if  browned flour  is used for the latter, the gravy will require but little cooking, but, when thickened with  raw flour,  it must cook until thoroughly done, or the gravy will taste like so much gummy paste.  It is best to brown a quart of  flour  at a time. Put in a skillet, set in the oven or on top of the stove, stir often until it is a light brown, put into a wide-mouthed bottle, cork, and keep for use.  All gravies should be well stirred over a rather hot fire, as they must be quickly made, and must boil, not simmer.

Boil one pound of  sweet potatoes,  let them get perfectly cold before grating them. In the meantime cream a heaping tablespoonful of  butter  and two tablespoonfuls of  sugar,  add gradually the  yelks of four eggs,  the grated  peel of a lemon,  a teaspoonful of  cinnamon,  a little grated  nutmeg  and one cup of  sweet milk;  add the   beaten  whites  last. Then grease a  pudding dish,  line with a  rich crust  and fill in the custard. To make it still richer, add a wineglassful of  brandy  to the  sweet potatoes.  Eat cold, with or without  sauce.

Lay the  fish  on its side and cut it from tail to head, taking care not to injure the belly by inserting the knife too far; wash the  fish  well, take out the eyes, and put a pinch of  salt  in their place; then sprinkle a handful or two of  brown sugar  over the inside, and above the  sugar  the same quantity, or rather more, of  common salt;  lay the  salmon  on a flat board, the inside up; cover with a cloth and let it remain twenty-four hours (or if wished saltish, thirty-six) in a dry place, neither too hot nor too cold. If the weather is fine, an hour or two of exposure to the sun and air will accelerate the curing process. The kipper is in perfection after it has been dried twenty-four hours, but it will keep a considerable time. To cook it, cut it in slices, wrap each in a piece of paper and fry it; send it to the table in paper.

In the first place, the greatest attention should be paid, to have all the things that are for use properly arranged, and appointing each attendant his proper place, and what he has to do. You will always find that the more help there is to wait on table, the more confusion there is, especially if their different offices are not pointed out before dinner by the servant that is to conduct the dinner. I have always found that one good servant that understands his business, can do more work in its proper order than three awkward ones, as they are chiefly in each other's way, and this causes a great confusion in the course of dinner. There are some families that think a servant ought to wait on eight or ten at dinner, but I tell them they are much mistaken; for this is too many for one man to wait upon, to do it to perfection; and especially if there are many changes. Therefore, my young friends, I have now brought you thus far; and given you general directions in the various branches before laid down,
